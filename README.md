## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
-   See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
-   View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

Started with seperating out components using basic jsx tags. Loaded in the JSON file, put it into the chart component. Create a barchart for every day. Then I styled it, and last but not least made it (kinda) responsive, by increasing the size of the bars when screens get bigger.

### Built with

-   React
-   CSS
